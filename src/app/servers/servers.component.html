<button class="btn btn-primary"
  [disabled]="!buttonStatus"
  (click)="onCreateServer()"
  >Create a Server
</button>

<p>{{ serverCreationStatus  }}</p>
<p>The button is tied by property-binding to a function called 'buttonStatus 
  in component.ts which, in turn, runs a timer, then flips false to true.</p>

<label>Server Name:</label>
<input type="text" class="form-control" [(ngModel)]='serverName'>
<p *ngIf="serverCreated; else noServer">A new server was created: {{ serverName }}</p>
<ng-template #noServer>
  <p>No server has been created yet.</p>
</ng-template>

<p>{{ message }}</p>

<p>Status of buttonStatus(): <span [innerText]="buttonStatus"></span> - property binding</p>
<p>Status of buttonStatus(): {{ buttonStatus }} - string interpolation</p>

<!-- Notice that you use [] for property binding and () for event binding.
Two-way binding combines the two - see [(ngModel)] Also, ng allows you to 
use all the old HTML events like onClick, onMouseOver, etc in an abbreviated
syntax. 

4 types of data binding: str interp., property, event, two-way
-->

<!-- Built-in directives go inside HTML attribute selectors, ie <p>, <div> 
  *ngIf - the star indicates this is a 'structural directive', changing the 
  structure of the DOM (either adding this element or not)

  ng-template is a marker w/c contains a local ref (or bookmark, as we used to
  call them), #noServer which displays as the else condition of ngIf
-->

<app-server *ngFor="let server of servers"></app-server>
